# Cacique Templates
Brackets extension that auto complete HTML, CSS and JS templates or insert them by a dialog. The templates were made based on my personal use. Feel free to fork and edit it!

## Usage
Select `Edit > Cacique Templates`. A dialog will appears with a select componet that contains a list of available templates. Choose one and it will be placed on the current document at the current cursor position. You can also access the dialog with the shortcut `alt + C`
